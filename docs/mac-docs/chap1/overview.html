<h2>Introducing SANLab-CM</h2>
<p>
This documentation is designed to introduce individuals to SANLab-CM's interface for the development of CPM-GOMS models and the execution of these models. This chapter will discuss the following topics:</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li><a href="section1.html">The SANLab-CM Interface</a> - An introduction to the SANLab-CM interface, its features, and some of the terminology used by SANLab-CM and its analogues in the literature</li>
<li><a href="section2.html">Instantiating Activities</a> - Learn about activity types, creating activities in a SANLab-CM model, and how to adjust activity parameters.</li>
<li><a href="section3.html">Using Interactive Routines</a> - Learn about interactive routines and how they can assist in the creation and management of a model.</li>
<li><a href="section4.html">Building a Basic Model</a> - A step-by-step walkthrough building a simple model via task analysis using all of the tools discussed so far.</li>
<li><a href="section5.html">Running a Model</a> - A discussion about running a model and some of the tools available to control model execution.</li>
<li><a href="section6.html">The Results Window</a> - Learn about the histogram and profile tool to look at the model output.</li>
<li><a href="section7.html">Analyzing Critical Paths</a> - Learn about the tools SANLab-CM offers to compare critical paths for a model.</li>
<li><a href="section8.html">Activity Criticality</a> - A look at tools to examine how often activities and interactive routines appear on the model's critical path.</li>
</ul>
